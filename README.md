# project-1-futureproof

## Names:
### Huseyin, Helder, Liam, Fatima

## What I/we have learned:
### We've learnt how how to call an API (GIPHY) using axios, based on a user input, and have this refresh and pull more data on button click. We've learnt how to route and redirect multiple pages and create a persistent page using a JSON file as a datastore. In addition to that we've managed to implement a comments feature, which allows users to comment on each post and hide/show comments, this is again using axios http requests and read/writing to our JSON file.

## What challenges I/we overcame:
### Initially there was the issue of presenting multiple GIFs at the same time, GIPHY provided pre-built UIs using their SDK kit, which we tried to implement but after a while realised it was mainly built to work with Typescript, a language we didn't have much experience with, to overcome this we built our own simple UI using some JQuery and simple CSS and looping to collect 5 images.

## What I/we struggled with:
### We struggled a lot with implementing the emoji reactions, the main issue was having a counter which was persistent to page reloads and worked on each blog post. We had the idea of following the same direction we did with the comments section but due to time constraints weren't able to pull it off - would be something to consider in the future. We also struggled with merging our work, we weren't clear enough with our communication and not experienced enough with github's conflict resolution and ended up merging duplicate code and functions ended up shifting position and not working as intended.

## What I/we would do differently next time:
### I'd say we would approach it in a more organised manner so that people's work didn't clash / overwrite. Might mean that we have multiple JS files so that the code is kept separate from eachother or that people wait for one part of the code to be written before they start their part

## Feedback

### Successes
* Managed to get the majority of the functionality ready 
* Relatively clean and well written code.
* Implemented templating engine.

### Improvements
* libs available for Ids - this will give an ID object rather than a random number (better practice). 
* gif functionality being executed client-side -> was this an intential move? Why?
* Standups seemed to be a little lacking in enthusiasm on 09/04. 

### Comments

* be careful of terminology - your `db.json` isn't really a database. 

Overall, the code is quite well written and is a solid foundation to build on. With a little more time, this would have been a little polished on the front end. A good job, well done!
